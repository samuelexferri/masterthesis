## Work

### Analysis

Evaluation of costs associated with running and storing Ethereum Smart Contracts using Solidity.

See the `analysis/` folder for all contracts.

### Analysis Truffle

Temporary folder used for compile and deploy a contract on local network with [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
Very useful for analyzing contracts and their costs in detail also thanks to the tool `ethereum-gas-report`.

See the `analysis-truffle/` folder for a ready Truffle project.

### NotarizETH

Smart Contract of the DApp [NotarizETH](https://notarizeth.xyz/).

Use some libraries from [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) for secure smart contract development.

See the `notarizeth/` folder for full contract.
